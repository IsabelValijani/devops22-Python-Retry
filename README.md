
# Ping-Pong protocol

## Description

The ping pong protocol is used whenever you want to test the connection between two devices. You write Ping and get back a pong message. I have also included a small test to check commands.

## Getting Started

Open VSC.
Run server then type in the terminal  >  python client.py  and press enter.
The request for name comes, write your name. In the terminal it will now say 'name' is connected.
Write ping and you get back a pong etc.
